And don‚Äôt look to Google and Facebook to fix this problem: to them, this problem is engagement, and makes their platforms more valuable.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/bradbarrish\">@bradbarrish</a> <a href=\"https://micro.whatevernevermind.com/2018/09/25/there-was-a.html\">linked a playlist of 20 songs</a> that ‚Äútruly represent [his] muscial point-of-view‚Äù. I loved the idea. It‚Äôs a vague prompt, and I‚Äôm interpreting it as 20 songs that shaped my musical taste. I‚Äôve ordered these in roughly chronological order of <em>when I was introduced to the songs</em>, not when they were released.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm also using this as an excuse to write up my memories of these songs, how I came to them, and what they meant to me. I wanted to pull this thread all the way through and add songs that are currently at the end of the threads these songs start, but the 20 song limitation wasn‚Äôt enough. That would be a fun follow-on.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/20-songs/pl.u-x5JlUMe3rM\">Apple Music Playlist</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/jalvani/playlist/4pZ5osyZRKVpFcawXfO9CE?si=As2AnvY4QJu01rXCYnu6vQ\">Spotify Playlist</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Jim Croce - <em>Operator</em></p>\n\n    <p>My Dad‚Äôs musical taste was varied, but I think he only knew four or five artists‚Äô names: Harry Belafonte, Randy Travis, Engelbert Humperdink, Neal Diamond, and Jim Croche. They all grated on me, except for Jim. <em>Bad, Bad Leroy Brown</em>, <em>Time In a Bottle</em>, <em>I Got A Name</em>. My favorite was the heartbreaking conversation Jim had with the operator when thinking of calling his ex. That‚Äôs still a resonant theme in music, some things don‚Äôt change. Simple guitar, a swelling refrain, and long car rides with my old man.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Beach Boys - <em>Sloop John B</em>.</p>\n\n    <p>Mom gave me a cassette of the Beach Boys‚Äô greatest hits when I was 3 or 4. I listened to it so much, I stretched the tape. I begged for a replacement, and stretched that one. Had to wait for a birthday to get another replacement. Sloop John B. and Wouldn‚Äôt It Be Nice were my favorites, but if I have to pick one, it‚Äôs an easy decision.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Beatles - <em>Eleanor Rigby</em></p>\n\n    <p>Concept Beatles are the best Beatles, and the grimy English city life that Eleanor Rigby evoked just really did it for me. The feeling of indvidualsliving in shared lonlieness is so well captured, and the string backing is perfect.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Billy Joel - <em>Downeaster ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù</em></p>\n\n    <p>Storm Front was one of the first albums I asked my parents to buy me, after hearing the single We Didn‚Äôt Start the Fire. Downeaster Alexa was hurt.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Heart - <em>Barracuda</em></p>\n\n    <p>I don‚Äôt have a specific memory of Barracuda, but I knew all the words as a kid, and it‚Äôs directly applicable to my love of Garbage, Amanda Palmer, Tori Amos, Pretty Girls Make Graves, etc. etc.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Amy Irving and Charles Fleischer - <em>Why Don‚Äôt You Do Right?</em></p>\n\n    <p>Like so many boys of my generation, I found Jessica Rabbit‚Ä¶eye opening. She turned me on to a lot of things, and one of them was smoky, sultry jazz singers.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pink Floyd - <em>Is Anybody Out There</em></p>\n\n    <p>I heard this song entirely out of context sitting on the floor of the living room of my childhood home, idly listening to my dad‚Äôs massive box of mixtapes and tapes of songs he‚Äôd recorded from the radio (remember how satisfying it was to get a perfect recording where you started the tape at just the right moment and the DJ didn‚Äôt interrupt with some asinine commentary), and Syd Barrett‚Äôs asking for acknowledgement resonated so strongly in me. I had no idea who it was - Dad didn‚Äôt know - but six or eight years later I heard <em>The Wall</em>, and everything made sense.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Ramones - <em>I Wanna Be Sedated</em></p>\n\n    <p>Energetic beats paird with lyrics of not wanting to feel this constant energy hit close to home. That‚Äôs being a teenager.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>David Bowie - <em>Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Suicide</em></p>\n\n    <p>‚ÄùOh! No, love, you‚Äôre <strong>not</strong> alone!‚Äù Chills. Every time.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The Doors - <em>The End</em></p>\n\n    <p>There aren‚Äôt words for The End, so I won‚Äôt force them.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Del the Funky Homosapien - <em>If You Must</em></p>\n\n    <p>Turned on by the Tony Hawk Pro Skater soundtrack, I couldn‚Äôt get enough of Del. When I heard Deltron 3030, it floored me. Hip Hop could be crerebral and funny and fun. It seems obvious now, but this was eye opening. (Pretty sure I remember it being ‚ÄúDel the Funkee Homosapien‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf Ya Must‚Äù on the game, though)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Tori Amos - <em>Datura</em></p>\n\n    <p>A friend at summer camp let me borrow <em>Under the Pink</em> overnight, and I listened to it in my bunk. I liked it, but she liked it more than I did, and that fact limited how close our friendship could be. <em>To Venus and Back</em>, on the other hand, grabbed me immediately and hasn‚Äôt let go. It‚Äôs been nearly 20 years.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>The Cure - <em>Just Like Heaven</em></li>\n  <li>Depeche Mode - <em>Enjoy the Silence</em></li>\n  <li>Nine Inch Nails - <em>Sanctified</em></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>New Order - <em>Age of Consent</em></p>\n\n    <p>These four, together, capture my teenage industrial/new-wave romanticism. <em>Age of Consent</em> captured the feeling of seeing the fist light after partying all night in some black basement while listening to the other three. Which was pretty much how I spent my late teens and early 20s.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Bjork - <em>Human Behavior</em></p>\n\n    <p>Oh man, <em>Human Behavior</em> opened my eyes. Before this, my only exposure to Bjork was <em>It‚Äôs Oh So Quiet</em>, which is great but made me think she was a ‚ÄúHappy music‚Äù person. Obviously, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Pixies - <em>Wave of Mutilation</em></p>\n\n    <p>I was tunred onto Pixies late, <em>Doolittle</em> came out in ‚Äò89, and I didn‚Äôt listen to it until I was in high school, probably a decade later. Didn‚Äôt matter. <em>Doolittle</em> is timeless.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Tool - <em>Parabol/Parabola</em></p>\n\n    <p>This is a bit of a cheat, but the crescendo between the two tracks makes it. This specific transition led me into Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Mogwai. Between classes in college, I walked into one of Baltimore‚Äôs great local record shops (Record and Tape Traders, which was apparently and dissapointingly bought by FYE)  and asked the guy behind the counter if he could think of anything else that made me feel the way that transition did; like a wave crashing on me, like tension being released. He nailed it.\nAlso, this isn‚Äôt on the playlists because Tool is regressivly keeping their music off streaming services. Hope they come around.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>At The Drive-In - <em>One-Armed Scissor</em></p>\n\n    <p>In 1999, At the Drive-In was supposed to be the future of punk. <em>Relationship of Command</em> was excellent, but the band dissolved, and Cedric and Omar moved on to the also-phenomenal The Mars Volta.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n",

I‚Äôve waxed and waned my RSS reading, sometimes going through periods where Digg or Reddit or Twitter gave me more of my news, but over the past few years I‚Äôve been back in Fever a lot.</p>\n\n<p>I didn‚Äôt know, but Fever‚Äôs creator and author, Shaun Inman, <a href=\"[shauninman.com/archive/2...](https://shauninman.com/archive/2016/12/24/goodbye_mint_goodbye_fever)\">killed</a> Fever and <a href=\"[haveamint.com](http://haveamint.com/)\">Mint</a> over a year ago in December 2016! It‚Äôs a testament to how well written this little PHP app is, and to self-hosting software, that my instances of Fever have been so reliable for so long. I‚Äôve done almost no maintenance, occasionally clearing disk space on the server, but that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs great. I only found out they were deprecated when I visited the site looking for information on using regex to filter specific posts from a couple of my feeds.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm looking for alternatives. I‚Äôm demoing <a href=\"[feedbin.com](https://feedbin.com)\">Feedbin</a> right now, and I like it so far. I do miss Fever‚Äôs clever aggregation feature<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, but I might be able to get something close by liberally applying auto-read actions, which actually very easily solved my needs I was using regex filters for in Fever. Good job, Feedbin!</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\">\n      <p>Fever had this cool concept where some feeds could be marked as ‚ÄúSparks‚Äù. They wouldn‚Äôt show up in your unread list, but they <em>would</em> add to a ‚ÄúHot‚Äù section. Feed items that used similar language or linked to the same URLs would be aggregated under ‚ÄúHot‚Äù, with more popular terms and links getting a higher temperature, and thus being ‚Äúhotter‚Äù. So clever, and super useful for especially for squeezing some benefit from the really high-volume feeds that I otherwise won‚Äôt read.¬†<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n",
