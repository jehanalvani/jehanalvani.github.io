From the Jim Henson Companyâ€™s <a href=\"[www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IZw2CoYztk)\">YouTube channel</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1967, Henson was contracted by IBM to make a film extolling the virtues of their new technology, the MT/ST, a primitive word processor. The film would explore how the MT/ST would help control the massive amount of documents generated by a typical business office. Paperwork Explosion, produced in October 1967, is a quick-cut montage of images and words illustrating the intensity and pace of modern business. Henson collaborated with Raymond Scott on the electronic sound track.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IZw2CoYztk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n",
