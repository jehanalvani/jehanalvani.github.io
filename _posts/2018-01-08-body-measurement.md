I've been lax in keeping track of my quantifiable health data since I moved from Baltimore. I've never been a big fan of having a scale at home since I can get obsessive over checking my weight which can lead to unhealthy decisions. Using the scale only weekly and at the gym was a big part of how I got into shape. 

But, my Crossfit gym doesn't have a scale, and I've been interested in capturing details more than just my weight, so I cracked and bought a Nokia Health (formerly Withings) [Body Cardio][bodycardio][^1]. I was apprehensive before buying, but **my verdict after a few weeks is that it's exactly what I want in a scale** by being much more than scales have been in the past.

Here's a quick summary of my favorite things about it:

* Is wifi[^1], not bluetooth, so it directly sends data to your profile on Nokia's health webapp
* Tracks weight, body composition (lean muscle mass, fat mass, body water weight, bone mass), BMI[^2], heartrate, and [Pulse wave velocity][pwv]
* *Does the above while differentiating between individuals in a household*

I have a profile, and so does Lindsay. My son climbs on the scale just about every day, but just to play. His measurements just get collected in a "no profile" bucket, and I clear them out every few days. 

Like many, I've been focusing on dropping fat after the holidays, and I've done exactly that, averaging a pound and a half loss since mid-December. I think a lot of that is thanks to the accountability provided by having these measurements.

[^1]: I did run into an issue where the app and documentation said that an account wasn't needed to get the scale on my wireless network. I figured it'd have me create an account later in the process. It didn't, and when I called support, the rep had me create an account, and go through the process again, and it worked just fine. 
[^2]: Setting aside arguments about the value of BMI, it's a metric that's interesting if you're tracking other metrics and don't get too hung up on it.
