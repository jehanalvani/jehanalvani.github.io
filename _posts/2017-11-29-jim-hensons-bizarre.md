[Adafruit posted this on their blog today][adafruitjh], and I'd never seen it before. From the [Jim Henson Companyâ€™s YouTube channel][jh youtube]:

>In 1967, Henson was contracted by IBM to make a film extolling the virtues of their new technology, the MT/ST, a primitive word processor. The film would explore how the MT/ST would help control the massive amount of documents generated by a typical business office. Paperwork Explosion, produced in October 1967, is a quick-cut montage of images and words illustrating the intensity and pace of modern business. Henson collaborated with Raymond Scott on the electronic sound track.
